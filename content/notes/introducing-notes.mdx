Creating the Notes stream gives me a space to publish ideas while they are still forming.

I expect these entries to be lightweight snapshots of experiments, instrumentation wins, and recurring questions from engineering partners. When a theme hardens into a repeatable pattern, it graduates into a longer essay.

Expect the cadence to be irregular; I write when the signal feels strong enough to share.
