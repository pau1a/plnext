Factories kept bolting new sensors onto legacy networks without a consistent way to deliver policy updates. I built a control plane that treats every gateway like a miniature service mesh while keeping engineers inside a simple dashboard.

- A Rust/WASM agent runs on constrained hardware, translating high-level intents into iptables, WireGuard, and MQTT rules.
- Nomad allocates update waves, ensuring only a slice of the fleet rolls forward at a time so operators can watch telemetry trends.
- Grafana boards surface posture drift alongside energy consumption so plant managers see the security tradeoffs in real time.

The orchestrator shrinks rollout cycles from weeks to hours, and pilots are already showing fewer midnight callouts.
