War rooms devolved into twenty people yelling over each other while the real work happened in side chats. Incident Navigator gives responders a single pane that watches signals, drafts actions, and keeps exec updates flowing without leaving the investigation timeline.

- Elixir processes the event firehose and scores contributor bandwidth, surfacing who is overloaded before they burn out.
- Copilot prompts pull from tagged playbook snippets, suggesting the next best action while still requiring human acknowledgement.
- A live storyboard assembles artefacts, threat intel, and decisions into a shareable brief that legal and PR can ship within minutes.

Teams stopped juggling eight tools and started shipping close-out reports inside the golden hour.
