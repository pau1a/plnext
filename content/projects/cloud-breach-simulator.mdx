I built a repeatable framework that spins up adversary scenarios in isolated cloud sandboxes. Each run provisions ephemeral infrastructure, executes scripted attack paths, and tears everything down once telemetry lands in the SIEM.

- Terraform modules provide region-specific hardening while keeping environments disposable.
- Step Functions orchestrate the execution graph and emit checkpoints to teams' Slack channels.
- Python runners perform credential abuse, persistence, and data exfiltration patterns aligned to MITRE ATT&CK.

The result is a safe way to validate detections weekly without risking customer workloads.
