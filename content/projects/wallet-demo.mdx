The wallet module ships _demo-first_, meaning the UI calls only sandbox endpoints and never touches a real provider while `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_MODE=demo`. A single flag swap flips the experience to production once real providers and contracts are wired.

## Implementation notes

- Demo API routes live under `/api/demo/*` and will hard fail when the flag is set to `live`.
- Live stubs return 501 until viem, relayers, and WebAuthn flows are connected.
- The `Proofs & Privacy` page documents what we store in demo versus live.

## Live readiness

Follow the flip checklist in the README to connect SIWE, tip recording, on-chain anchoring, and humanity attestations. The contract stub in `contracts/PostRegistry.sol` anchors content once deployed.
