Energy operators needed to stress-test control rooms without touching live substations. Spectral Digital Twin clones their SCADA stack, emulates telemetry noise, and lets defenders rehearse drills against real adversary tradecraft.

- Go services replay months of historian data with adjustable fault injection so teams can practise black-start scenarios safely.
- Kubernetes blueprints spin up entire substations in minutes, including simulated PLCs and network taps for OT sensors.
- TimescaleDB stores every injected anomaly and analyst response so audit teams can replay the exercise with second-by-second context.

The prototype already uncovered firmware edge cases that would have been catastrophic in the field.
