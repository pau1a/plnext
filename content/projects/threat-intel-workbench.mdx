Threat feeds rarely align with what an organisation actually sees on its network. To bridge that gap I prototyped a workspace that combines commercial feeds, open-source intelligence, and local detections.

- API workers normalise disparate indicators and enrich them with sandbox detonation results.
- Analysts triage collections inside a React-based UI that tracks hypotheses and coverage.
- Language models summarise investigations, but humans always approve findings before publication.

Teams now catch overlaps in minutes rather than hours, keeping playbooks current while evidence is still relevant.
