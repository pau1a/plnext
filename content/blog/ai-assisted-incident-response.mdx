Large language models are excellent at summarising noisy telemetry, but only when supplied with context. Build playbooks that gather the right packet captures, logs, and identity events before invoking automation. The model should answer specific questions, not take a free-form guess at what happened.

Once analysts can trust the input, LLMs become force multipliers for the parts of the workflow that are tedious yet essential:

- Drafting containment guidance tailored to the affected systems.
- Translating forensic findings into updates executives understand.
- Enumerating follow-up tasks so hand-offs between shifts stay crisp.

AI never replaces the responder who decides whether to pull a circuit breaker. Instead, it clears the noise so that human judgment is applied where it matters most.
