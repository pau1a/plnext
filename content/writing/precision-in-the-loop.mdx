The first constraint we name in every automation review is time. Not throughput, not load, but the specific windows where a human needs to see the state of the machine and be ready to act.

I map those windows explicitly, pairing alarms with rehearsed responses so crews never guess when to step in. That choreography keeps precision in the loop even as the system scales.
