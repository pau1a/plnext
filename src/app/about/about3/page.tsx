        <h2>From RF to AI-secured automation</h2>
        <p>
          My career began in military radio and satellite systems and matured through large-scale IP networking. Today I focus on
          AI-enabled operations for industrial environments. I design layered defences, instrument estates so risk is measured not
          guessed, and remove toil with code so teams can focus on the hard problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shape security by design for OT and automation programmes and align controls to recognised standards such as IEC 62443.
          I am the person teams tap to untangle cross-discipline problems when they cut across layers and refuse to fit into one box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past year I have gone deep on Python-first machine learning and modern data tooling. I build guardrails that let
          models survive contact with production, including secure MLOps, model and data lineage, drift detection, and adversarial
          robustness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Postgraduate study sharpened the theory. I hold an MSc Cyber Security and a PGDip Cyber. My dissertation explored how
          cryptographic transparency and distributed ledgers can strengthen identity and provenance across industrial supply chains.
          Applied cryptography is part of the toolbox. I use signatures, attestations and transparency logs, with blockchain only
          where it reduces risk and friction for integrity, provenance and tamper-evident logging.
        </p>
        <p>
          My operating style is measurement-led. Results look like lower MTTR, fewer false positives, safer change windows and
          quieter on-call. I prefer simple, observable architectures to clever, brittle ones. Controls and infrastructure should be
          code. Runbooks should be testable. Recovery should be unremarkable.
        </p>
        <h2>Constants</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Narrow the blast radius</li>
          <li>Increase visibility</li>
          <li>Shorten recovery</li>
          <li>Keep people out of headlines</li>
        </ul>
