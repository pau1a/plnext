# Paula Livingstone Web Experience

This repository powers Paula Livingstoneâ€™s personal site and portfolio, combining writing, project highlights, and contact routes in one place.

All design, architecture, and content rules live in [`/docs/`](docs/), so start there when planning changes.

**Stack overview:** Next.js 15 app directory, Bootstrap utility layer, and custom SCSS tokens.

## Local development

Run the site locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Static export via `next export` is supported for CDN uploads once content stabilises.

For architecture, palette, and writing standards, see `/docs/`.
