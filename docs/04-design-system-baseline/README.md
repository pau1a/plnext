# Design System Baseline Overview

This folder houses the four foundational design references for the Paula Livingstone site:

1. [`palette-graphite-teal.md`](palette-graphite-teal.md) — colour tokens and usage guidance.
2. [`typography.md`](typography.md) — type scale, weights, and rhythm.
3. [`components.md`](components.md) — UI primitives and states.
4. [`motion.md`](motion.md) — animation easing, timing, and accessibility limits.
