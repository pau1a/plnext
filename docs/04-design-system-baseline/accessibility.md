# Accessibility Baseline

- Contrast: WCAG AA minimum on text and interactive elements.
- Focus: clearly visible focus rings; never removed.
- Motion: reduced-motion users get static UI.
- Semantics: headings logical; landmarks (header/main/footer) present.
- Media: alt text required; code blocks have accessible labels.
