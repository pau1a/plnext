# Purpose and Scope

**What this site exists to do**  
PaulaLivingstone.com is the professional and intellectual home of Paula Livingstone. It documents, demonstrates, and explains work at the intersection of cybersecurity, operational technology, and applied AI — through selected projects, essays, and experiments.

**Who it’s for**  
Collaborators, peers, and organisations who want to understand Paula’s approach to building reliable, secure, and intelligent systems.

**What it isn’t**  
Not a product marketing site, not a newsfeed, not a social diary. Publishing is selective: clarity and permanence over frequency or reach.
