# Discovery Questions for Ged's Personal Site

## 1. Vision and Purpose
1. What is the site for — portfolio, personal blog, professional hub, or brand platform?
2. Who is the intended audience — recruiters, collaborators, followers, or clients?
3. What story or feeling do you want visitors to take away in the first 10 seconds?
4. Does the current site actually express that purpose, or is it generic scaffolding?
5. What differentiates this personal site from LinkedIn or your project pages?

## 2. Information Architecture
6. What pages currently exist, and what pages are truly needed?
7. How is navigation structured — is it intuitive, minimal, or meandering?
8. Where should dynamic or frequently updated content (like posts or projects) live?
9. Do we need a search function, or are we keeping it deliberately simple?
10. How will users find their way back to the home narrative from any subpage?

## 3. Content and Voice
11. Is any of the content generated by the LLM still present verbatim?
12. Does the tone reflect your actual writing style — direct, intelligent, concise — or a model’s generic phrasing?
13. Are we weaving in your real biography and milestones, or placeholder blurbs?
14. How will future content be written and maintained — Markdown files, CMS, or manual edits?
15. Is there a blog or article system planned, and if so, who curates or edits it?

## 4. Design and Identity
16. What is the colour palette, and does it align with your established brand style?
17. How were typography choices made — aesthetic preference, legibility, or random defaults?
18. Does the layout scale beautifully on mobile and large displays?
19. Are we using any visual motifs or patterns that echo your other sites (e.g., NetworkLayer, Technofatty)?
20. What’s missing visually that would make it feel distinctly Paula Livingstone?

## 5. Technical Architecture
21. What stack is the site running on (Next.js, plain HTML, static generator, etc.)?
22. Is it hosted locally, on DigitalOcean, or elsewhere?
23. Are there build/deploy scripts defined yet?
24. Does the project structure anticipate growth — blog posts, portfolio entries, or integrations?
25. Is the repo clean of scaffolding junk (unused CSS, test routes, etc.) from the LLM output?

## 6. Performance and Accessibility
26. Have we measured Lighthouse performance scores?
27. Is lazy-loading or code-splitting used where appropriate?
28. Does it meet basic accessibility standards (semantic HTML, contrast, ARIA)?
29. Are image assets optimised or are we serving raw heavy files?
30. How does it perform over slow mobile data or low-spec devices?

## 7. SEO and Metadata
31. Are meta tags and Open Graph data properly configured?
32. Does it use structured data (schema.org) for search visibility?
33. What’s the canonical URL structure?
34. Have we written meaningful alt text for images?
35. Is there a sitemap and robots.txt in place?

## 8. Analytics, Security, and Maintenance
36. Are we tracking visitor behaviour (PostHog, Plausible, etc.) and respecting privacy laws?
37. How are environment variables and secrets managed (e.g., API keys)?
38. Is the repo under version control with proper branching and PR hygiene?
39. What’s the backup or rollback plan if a deploy breaks?
40. How often do we intend to review and iterate on content, design, and strategy?
