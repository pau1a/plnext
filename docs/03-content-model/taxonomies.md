# Taxonomies — Tags now, Categories later

**Now**
- Use tags freely in posts (e.g., "ot","ml","pytorch","resilience").

**Later**
- Categories will be added after ~1 year of posts.
- Keep `categorySlug` optional in front-matter.
- Categories get their own listing URLs (`/blog/category/[slug]`).
- We’ll keep a central registry (title, slug, description, color).

Rationale: categorisation emerges from actual writing patterns. See decisions/0002-categories-later.md
