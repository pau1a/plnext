# Front Page Content Style Guide

## Tone
Precise first-person voice with minimal ornament. Every sentence should clarify intent, impact, or invitation without metaphor or filler.

## Copy Length Targets
- **Hero:** ≤ 12 words.
- **Introduction:** ≈ 70 words.
- **Core Work / Themes:** 18 words per description.
- **Featured Writing:** 24-word abstracts per entry.
- **Ethos / Philosophy:** Two statements ≤ 25 words each; commitment bullets ≤ 10 words.
- **Contact & Connection:** Primary CTA label ≤ 4 words; footnote ≤ 18 words.
- **Footer:** Navigation labels 1–2 words.

## Typographic Hierarchy
- **H1:** Hero statement.
- **H2:** Section headings for Introduction, Core Work / Themes, Featured Writing, Ethos / Philosophy, Contact & Connection, Footer.
- **H3:** Minor labels such as card titles, carousel metadata, or supplemental cues.

## Motion Ethics
“No distraction in first 5 seconds.” Limit animation to purposeful, focus-guiding transitions. Any motion should complete within 300ms and be user-triggered.

## Imagery Guidance
Hero assets live at `cdn/images/hero/`. Use horizontal compositions for wide layouts and vertical crops for narrow breakpoints. Apply consistent graphite-to-teal grading for cohesion and maintain descriptive alt text aligned with the Accessibility expectations.
